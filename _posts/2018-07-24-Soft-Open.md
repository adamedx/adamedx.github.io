The site theme is working, so I'm ready to start posting. I'm using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), and so far my initial annoyance at having to understand it is vastly outweighed by this one great thing: I can write blog posts locally in my editor using Markdown and publish via a `git push`.

If I could get the world to optimize for the [Lynx browser](https://lynx.browser.org/) I could realize the dream of never leaving the command shell.
