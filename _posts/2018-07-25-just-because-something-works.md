These days I have a fun [open source project](https://github.com/adamedx/poshgraph) to entertain me after hours. It does have some relationship to my professional endeavors, but mostly it's just an enjoyable way for me to learn and practice some skills.

I think it's healthy for software engineers who have been in the profession for a minute to find their own "voice" on both the process of making software and the software itself. You might find you're able to step outside of the engineering box and exercise some product management muscle for instance. And of course you can scratch the itch of answering the question of what would happen if *you* got to call all the shots on a project -- it would be wildly successfuly of course, right?

Now that the tools and infrastructure for developing serious software are available **for free* from the Githubs, Bitbuckets et. al. of the world, there is even less reason not to dream up some software and make a go of it. Worst case you'll learn something, i.e. a new language, programming paradigm, framework, infrastructure technology, etc. You may even meet new people or find a community.

I'll share more on my specifc project later. My key encouragement for you is that if you consider software engineering a calling, you should eventually get out there and make something of your own devising in indepenent of work.

Hmm, I just realized this post's content has drifted from its title -- my apologies for the now out-of-context [Shuri](https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/2/20/17030266/black-panther-shuri-letitia-wright-best) reference. But maybe changing the meaning of "works" makes it fit somehow...
