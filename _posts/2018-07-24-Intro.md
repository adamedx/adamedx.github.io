Hello and welcome. Here is my initial thinking on what topics will be covered in this blog:

* Anything related to computer science or software engineering (it's my vocation after all)
* [Open source projects](https://github.com/adamedx), including those I maintain or to which I contribute
* [Black culture](http://thewright.org/)
* [Afrofuturism](https://www.ebony.com/entertainment-culture/black-alt-enter-afrofuturism-999)
* [Detroit, Michigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit), my hometown
* Intersection of technology and human society

It's a varied list, but at least it's finite. If you're looking for technical posts, you will find some here. On the other topics I will at least attempt to speak from the perspective of experience if not actual expertise. And eventually I hope to share some of the unanswered questions that arise as I explore numerous topics or simply go about my day.

I'll admit my goals for this blog are not yet well-defined. I am certain that I'd like to document my "findings of life" on the site's topics as they may be useful to me or others at some point. And at least in this time, I see value in making public statements on **truth** and **ethics**, which are at this time under attack.

Less urgently, I may reference posts here to participate in the internet's cauldron of social media discourse.

Thank you for visiting.
